<h1>CODEWARS</h1>
<h3>This repository was created to hold my answers/submissions for codewars katas, because I imagine I am going to need some of these code snippets for future projects</h3>
<h4>Below you will find some descriptions of my solutions</h4>
<ul>
    <li>dist_2d_points.js: Uses a simple geometry concept, the distance between two 2D points a and b = ((a.x - b.x)^2 + (a.y - b.y)^2) ^ 0.5</li>
    <li>leap_years.c: checks if a given year is a leap year or not using the definition of a leap year: divisible by 4, but not divisible by a 100, except if it is divisible by 400.</li>
</ul>
